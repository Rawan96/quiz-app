# Quiz App

This is a simple quiz app, so when you open the app five randomly questions will appear and when you finish answering them you will receive your score and if you want to replay the game of course you can!

## Application Setup:

* Clone this repo.
* cd quiz-app then run npm i.
* Then run npm start.
* the app is running now in your browser :)
